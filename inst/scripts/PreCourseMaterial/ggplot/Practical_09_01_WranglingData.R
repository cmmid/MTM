# Consider an extension to the SIR model from the lecture where a disease,
# languorem secundus, has two stages of infection. Infected individuals are
# only infectious during the first phase of infection. Mortality follows only
# after the second phase of infection.
#
# 100 simulations have been performed in order to understand the disease's
# prevalence and incidence in the population. A CSV file has been provided for
# each of the four populations in the model:
#  S  - susceptible
#  I1 - first stage of infection
#  I2 - second stage of infection
#  R  - deceased
#
# The model used to simulate the disease is

# A. Reading in data
#############################

# A.1 Read in the CSV files and convert them to a single wide format data frame

S  <- read_csv("S.csv")
I1 <- read_csv("I1.csv")
I2 <- read_csv("I2.csv")
R  <- read_csv("R.csv")

all_dat <- bind_rows(S, I1, I2, R) # pull together into one data frame

#############################
# B. Plotting a single simulation
#############################

# B.1 Select the time and key columns along with one of the simulation runs.
# Use the `group`, `color` or `fill` aesthetic with the `key` column to produce
# a visualisation of all four populations of interest, S, I1, I2, R. You may
# choose any plotting geometry you consider appropriate from the documentation:
#
# https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/reference/index.html

# General skeleton:
all_dat %>%
    dplyr::select(time, key, value = ???) %>%

# C. Calculating the prevalence and incidences
#############################

# C.1 Reshape the data frame from wide (100 simulations side by side) to long
# format (stacked atop each other). This so we can repeatedly apply the
# calculations to all simulations at once.
#
# NB: we want to gather only on the columns labelled X1, X2 ... X100, not
# on the time and key.

                       key = simulation, # copied from column names
                       value = value,    # name of new "value" column
                       -c(time, key))    # don't gather on time or key

# C.2 Read in the parameters used to simulate the population trajectories. We
# need these values so that we can do a join with the simulations and calculate
# the prevalence and incidence post hoc (remembering best practice is to do
# this during the model simulation

parameters <- read_csv("precourse/ggplot/100_simulations_parms.csv")

# headings: time, simulation, S, I1, I2, R

#   prev1 - fraction of the non-deceased population with stage 1 disease

# C.5 Using the `select()` function, make a data frame that contains the time,
# simulation index & our two new incidence variables, the initial S population,
# S0. Gather this data frame so that the two incidence variable are stacked
# atop each other so that we can calculate incidence rates as incidence/S0 and
# cumulative incidence as the cumulative integral of these incidence rates
